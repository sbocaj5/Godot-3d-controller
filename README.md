# Overview

This is a 3d person controller designed in godot using help from the documentation and a lot of help from a sereis of tutorial videos. I created this simply to see if I could actually work in a 3d envirment in godot as it's original design was mostly ment for 2d games and while there is some support for 3d it still mostly a 2d system

# Development Environment

This is Godot an open source that allows anyone to make therer own games it is both compltly free and community supported making it great to begin writing games in as it has no start cost.

Godot has its own language called GDscript which is a child of python making it very similar to our classes main scripts
